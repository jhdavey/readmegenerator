## Usage
  
Once you have installed the app, right click on one of your files in the directory you're working in. Click "Open in Integrated Terminal". Then in your command line, type `node index.js`. You will see that you begin to get prompts to fill in the details for your README sections. Fill out each prompt. At the end, the app will generate your README file automatically!
